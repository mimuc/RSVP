Cooking a homemade pizza is a fun and delicious activity. I start by making the dough from scratch, combining flour, water, yeast, and a pinch of salt. After kneading the dough, I let it rise until it doubles in size. Meanwhile, I prepare the tomato sauce by simmering tomatoes with garlic, oregano, and olive oil. Once the dough is ready, I roll it out into a thin crust and spread the sauce on top. Then, I sprinkle a generous amount of cheese and add my favorite toppings, such as mushrooms, bell peppers, and olives. Finally, I bake the pizza in a hot oven until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted. The aroma that fills the kitchen is simply irresistible.
