Cooking is a passion of mine. I enjoy experimenting with different ingredients and flavors. One of my favorite dishes to prepare is spaghetti Bolognese. It's a classic Italian recipe that never fails to satisfy. I start by saut√©ing onions and garlic in olive oil until they become fragrant. Then, I add ground beef and cook it until it browns. Next, I pour in crushed tomatoes and simmer the sauce for about an hour, allowing the flavors to meld together. Finally, I serve the Bolognese sauce over al dente spaghetti, garnished with freshly grated Parmesan cheese. It's a hearty and delicious meal that always brings joy to the table.
